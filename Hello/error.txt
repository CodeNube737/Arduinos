can Arduino IDE's output not run print after compilation?
Great question ‚Äî and yes, that's correct in a certain sense. Here's the breakdown:

üß† What "Print After Compilation" Really Means
The Arduino IDE compiles your sketch into machine code and uploads it to your microcontroller (like an Arduino Uno).

After that, it's the microcontroller itself that runs the code, not the IDE.

So if you're expecting the IDE to display Serial.print() output automatically after compiling, it won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not like running C++ in an IDE with a console ‚Äî the magic happens on the board!

üñ•Ô∏è How to See Output
To view printed output, make sure to:

Use Serial.begin(9600); in setup()

Use Serial.print() or Serial.println() to output text

Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (top-right icon or Ctrl+Shift+M)

Set the baud rate in the Serial Monitor to match Serial.begin() (usually 9600)

Only then will you see the output ‚Äî it's coming from the board, through the USB connection, into the Serial Monitor. Not from the IDE itself.

Let me know what kind of output you‚Äôre hoping to get ‚Äî maybe we can spice it up with LED feedback or a tiny OLED screen! üòÑ
