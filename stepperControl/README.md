# Stepper Motor Control C++ Project

This project is a starting point for controlling a stepper motor using C++ on Windows. It is based on Arduino code, which will be adapted for desktop C++ usage.

## How to Build

1. Make sure you have CMake and a C++ compiler (like MSVC or MinGW) installed.
2. Open this folder in VS Code.
3. Use the provided build tasks or run CMake manually:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

## Next Steps
- Replace the contents of `main.cpp` with your adapted Arduino logic.
- Add any required libraries for stepper motor control on your platform.
